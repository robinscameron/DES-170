			This course focuses on more advanced techniques of designing and coding for the web. We will solve the problems at hand by creating design and content with our classmates that serve both form and function that develop strategies for digital building. 
<br><br>
			Students will complete both readings and discussions, learning from a textbook as well as advanced practical knowledge about how digital design functions on the web. They will participate in group projects, take ownership of roles and see how teams are structured. Again, we will look at topics concerning the history of coding and the internet, and some contemporary digital theory. In practical terms the course will continue to learn of HTML + CSS, adding some simple Javascript concepts, animated gifs, social media campaigns, setting up a CMS system, advanced UX, story building and asset creation. The final project will be a multi-page website based in a CMS system with content that the student will create.  		 </p> </div>

		  Readings
		  </h1>
		Every week there will be readings that will expand on the ideas discussed in the course. The readings are writings taken from many vantage points and from varying moments of the web's history. These readings will broaden your scope and allow you to be open minded about concepts that you may be able to utilize in your own work.
		You will be expected to write a 200 word response (save in your Are.na Channel) to the reading and the week you are presenting your site you will be responsible for leading the discussion.
		<br><br>
		  
		<h1>
		  Presentations
		  </h1>
		  Each week one student will give a breif presentation of a website that they have found that inspires them, the student will walk the class through details that they notice about the website in a detailed session. I’ll start us off with one so we know what to expect. There will be a sign-up sheet available. Which ever week you choose you will also be responsible for leading the discussion that week.
		  Sign up <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jFfRKU0mJ-K770ILzdI15UqFvwGCN0GCCN6L4p3ZvNg/edit#gid=0">here</a>. 
		
		  <br><br>
		<h1>
		 Are.na sketchbook 
		  </h1>
		In order to keep your ideas organized we will utilize the website Are.na. This will be a sort of ‘digital sketchbook’ for what you come across in your research. As part of your grade you will be expected to have an Are.na channel with at least 20 blocks of inspiration / images / digital content that you’ve been gathering for the course and your projects, there is a chrome extension that might come in handy. You can also take notes directly in Are.na if you like. At the end of the course there will be an option to print a PDF or a book of your findings
		
		  <br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Lab Fees
		  </h1>
		
		  Lab fees for this and other designated courses in the Department of Art, Architecture and Design are set at $100 per student. They provide funding for many of the consumable materials, supplies, and services provided for your use in the course. Most of these are purchased on your behalf at quantity discounts that would be unavailable if purchasing the materials individually. Depending on the class, lab fees may also provide for specialized design software accessible to you in the department’s PC and Mac labs, and through remote use in the virtualization of those computer terminals. Those classes that utilize the university’s Design Labs will have a portion of their fee directed to cover materials and other shop consumables such as blades, abrasives and adhesives. In courses that include site visits to off-campus locations, lab fees may also cover some or all the cost of group travel and transportation. 

		  In this course, the majority of the lab fee is budgeted for web hosting and domain name purchase, if desired. <br><br> The class textbook “Javascript + JQuery” is mandatory reading.
		  
		  The lab fee will provide the minimum required for the successful completion of the course. However, throughout the semester, you may also need to purchase additional materials and supplies on your own.  What you decide to purchase and how much you spend will vary depending on the design choices you make. Spending more money may not make for a better project, although sometimes a good idea requires an investment to see it through. More likely, it will require time and effort rather than money.  It is recommended that total additional out of pocket expenses for this course be kept to around $20 to $40.

		  <h1>
			End-of-Semester Cleanup		  </h1>
		
			When classes are over for the semester, before you depart campus and before the end of examination period, you are individually responsible for cleaning out the desk or work area that was assigned to you, and any projects, materials, or waste that remain there.  This means completely clearing off your desk surface; cleaning out any drawers or storage that were assigned to you; disposing of waste in or around your desk; and taking home or disposing of all projects that you produced for the course.  Your work area should be completely empty and clean, the way that it looked on day one of the semester.  Your instructor will review your work area at the end of the semester to ensure you have completed doing this.
